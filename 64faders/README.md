!()[app-64_faders.png]

basically, select a midi channel to output from. the bottom row selects which 'page' of faders is in use. go through and map these to whatever daw you are using. the midi cc outs are listed on the app and you can adjust the slide speed (need a little work). uses the awesome monome control max5 objects by jim drake.
