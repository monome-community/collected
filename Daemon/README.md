Daemon is an app that combines five step sequencers with tools for advanced harmonic control. It has a simple sine wave sound engine but can also be used in MIDI mode or a combination of the two. Each sequencer features independent tempo and the ability to sync to rewire.

Daemon was created to allow greater control over more traditional harmony and to let the user switch between chords with the press of a single button.
