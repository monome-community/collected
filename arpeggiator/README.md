this patch allows you to move an arpeggiated chord around a 2D MIDI keyboard (fourths).  pressing a button to the left or right of the chord shifts all the notes in the chord up or down by 5 semitones.  pressing a button above or below a given note will move that note up or down by one semitone.  pressing one of the notes in the chord will change the direction of the arpeggio.  the velocity of the three notes and the speed of the arpeggio can be changed via max controls.  virtual monome is included in the patch, but I have to admit it's much more fun on a real monome...

##key controls
space bar = start/stop\\
d/j = shift chord left/right\\
r/f = move left note up/down\\
t/g = move center note up/down\\
y/h = move right note up/down
